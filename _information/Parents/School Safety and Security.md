# **SCHOOL SAFETY AND SECURITY**

Safety and security are of outmost importance in MJS. We take a whole school approach to ensure every individual take personal responsibility for their own safety and look out for safety of others. &nbsp; Some of the critical information are shared below: &nbsp;  

*   The opening hours of the school gates are as follows:

| Gates 	| Monday to Friday<br>(during school term days, excluding public / school holidays) 	|
|---	|---	|
| Main Gate<br>(Front) 	| **6.30 am to 6.00 pm**<br>**(closed during dismissal period from 1.15 pm to 1.55 pm)** 	|
| Side Gate 	| • **6.30 am to 7.30 am**<br>• **1.55 pm to 6.00 pm** 	|

*   For the safety and security of students and staff, all visitors to the school are required to register at the Security Guard Post with a photo ID as proof of identity.
*   Visitors will then be issued with a Visitor Pass, which must be worn at all times while they are within the school’s premise.&nbsp;
*   Visitors’ movements are restricted to only non-teaching areas, e.g. the book shop and dental clinic, General Office etc within the ground level.&nbsp;
*   During dismissal time, parents / caregivers fetching students should wait at the school gates (front and side) area. They are not allowed to wait within the school compound. There is no visitor parking within the school premise. All visitor are advised to park at nearby HDB open carparks situated within walking distances to the school’s side gate.&nbsp;

**Road and Parking Safety**  

*   Parents and Caregivers are advised&nbsp;**NOT to drop the students at the front gate**&nbsp;at all times as that zone is a potential accident site with high traffic from vehicles from multiple roads.&nbsp;**Do park the cars safely in the carparks just outside of the side gate before dropping students off.**&nbsp;
*   Obey all road safety rules and regulations while making your way to school. Always walk along the designated footpaths where possible instead of road / carparks. While using pedestrian walking, do pause and visually check to ensure it is safe to cross (e.g. the vehicles have stopped) even when you have the right of way.
