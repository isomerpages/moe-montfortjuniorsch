# **HOMEWORK POLICY**

_Guidelines for the Assignment of Homework and Responsibilities of Pupils, Staff and Parents_  

**I. Purpose:**

Homework is an out-of-classroom learning experience that is a valuable part of schooling and the whole learning experience. Homework establishes positive study habits, promotes self directed learning and inculcates a sense of responsibility and discipline.

This Homework Policy serves to document the schools belief in the value and purpose of homework. The policies and practices outlined in this document serve the needs of the school curriculum and meet the realistic expectations of pupils, teachers and parents. It affirms the partnership in learning between parents and teachers and recognizes the importance of school-family life balance through the amount and types of homework set.

  

**II.  Definition:**

Homework is defined as meaningful and quality work assigned to pupils that is intended to be completed during non-instructional hours (outside school curriculum time).

**Homework assignments include:**

*   **Completion** of work assigned during the school day but not completed in class.
*   **Practice** exercises that help pupils to review and reinforce skills and concepts taught in class.
*   **Preview** assignments to prepare for subsequent lessons
*   **Extension** assignments to explore or transfer new skills or concepts to new situations and may include creative activities to integrate many skills toward the production of a response or product 

**Homework should: **

*   Reinforce principles, skills, concepts, and information taught in the classroom.
*   Be meaningful and appropriate to the ability and instructional level of pupils.
*   Support creative, logical, critical and analytical thinking.
*   Foster self-discipline, self motivation and the wise and orderly use of time.
*   Be adequately explained by teachers and clearly understood by parents.


**III.      Policy**

Timing, Scheduling and Quantity of homework:

Actual time required to complete assignments will vary with each pupil’s study habits, academic skills, and collective class workload.  A child should not be spending an inordinate amount of time doing homework.  Pupils are encouraged to pursue non-assigned, independent, leisure reading and spend time revising on what’s imparted currently.

Homework should not be assigned on days of special significance such as Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Deepavali and other national declared public holidays. Homework assigned for school holidays should also be measured and appropriate bearing in mind the need to support personal and family wellness.

Late-Work Policies

Pupils are expected to turn work in on time.  Those who turn in late assignments on a consistent basis will receive any of the following based upon school and class rules:

*   communication with parents
*   after school detention
*   missed reward activity (deprived of positive reinforcement)
*   behavioural management actions

Pupils who miss homework because of an absence (with medical certificate or approved letter) will receive the opportunity to make up missed work.  They are given _one calendar day for each day absent plus one extra day to turn in their work_ (_dependent on teacher’s discretion_).  It’s the pupils’ responsibility to follow up on work missed due to illness or absence.

Major Projects / Assignments for Assessment

Major projects include group or individual projects and other assignments teachers designate as major work to be included in the summative grade (assessments).  Work on these projects must be assigned with clear objectives and ample time for pupil to complete. These guidelines must be clearly depicted and parents are to be informed.

*   **_Note_** \- Assignments that require going to the public library or research must be assigned over a weekend to accommodate working families (and considerations for conditions for completion).

**Annex A**

**Late-Work Policy**

Pupils who consistently turn in late or incomplete assignments or who fail to submit assignments will be subject to progressive consequences:

i)       Communication with parents:

When pupils fail to hand up completed assignments in a timely manner, teachers will communicate the situation with parents through the Pupils Handbook or a phone call to reiterate the expectations and to assist in monitoring homework. Pupils can be set another deadline for completion of homework or be assigned to complete work in school after school hours or any other appropriate time as decided by the teacher.

ii)      After-School Detention:

Failure to complete homework on-time for class will result in an immediate/delayed\* detention either after-school or any other appropriate designated time.

·       If a pupil does not have the homework completed for a class that meets the assigned time frame, he/she will be assigned an after-school detention to complete that homework (teacher to inform parent of the assigned detention).

·       If he/she does not complete homework for a class that meets the assigned detention for the day, the teacher will inform the parent and further actions to be taken. After-school detention takes place and is supervised by the teacher. When pupil fails to report to the assigned after-school detention, it will/may lead to an office assigned detention by the Pupil Management Department (refer to consequences listed in the School Handbook).

iii)       Behavioural Management Actions

If a pupil persistently fails to complete homework despite undergoing After-School detentions, the pupil will be subjected to further behavioural management actions which may include suspension from class. Parents will also be called to the school to work out an intervention plan together with the teachers and school leaders.
