<h1><strong>MONTFORT JUNIOR PARENTS CONNECTION</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Montfort Junior Parents Connection (MJPC)</strong>&nbsp;comprises
of a group of inclusive and passionate parents who come together as volunteers
to support the school, achieve the goal of educating and developing our
boys to be Men for Others.</p>

between the parents and the school on matters related to their children.
They will also lead other parent volunteers in helping out in school activities

child’s overall development. It sends a positive signal of the parents’
love for the child and delivers the message to them that they are not alone.

their motivation in participating in the various school programmes and
activities, resulting in their holistic development.</p>
